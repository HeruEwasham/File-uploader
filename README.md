# File uploader

This is a program that uses Putty's pscp-command to upload files to remote server.

## Why use this instead of the command line directly?

This program lets you add multiple files and folders, instead of just one. This is done by calling pscp for every file/folder defined.

## What is needed

For this program to work, you need Putty's pscp command installed and working (can call it in cmd from everywhere).
